# PerfectShow

Welcome to PerfectShow, an image processing application for Android platform.

Up until now, I release functionalities about make-up.

This project mainly use [stasm](http://www.milbo.users.sonic.net/stasm/) for face detecting, [dlib](http://dlib.net/) can be more superior and robust, and it use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) for color blending and image processing, so you might as well have a good grasp of this field.

# Usage
Run the command below to pull OpenCV module in Android Studio project, then build the project.
```sh
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

For Win32/Linux project, [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) (CLI mode or GUI mode) is needed to generate native makefiles. Out-of-source build is recommended, as you can build multiple variants in separate directories. Compilers need to support some C++11 features, *Visual Studio* 2013 or newer works fine.
```sh
$ cd iShow/src/main/cpp/jni
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j4
```
