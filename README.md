# PerfectShow

Welcome to PerfectShow, an image processing application for Android platform.

Up until now, I release functionalities about make-up.

Currently I use Eclipse project instead of Android Studio project, since the former IDE has a shallow directory hierarchy, and NDK building is easier to use.
This project mainly use OpenCV library for image processing, so you might as well have a good grasp of this field.

# Usage
1. Download Android OpenCV SDK from official site of [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html), extract the archived package to somewhere *&lt;OpenCV-android-sdk&gt;*, then import the project under *&lt;OpenCV-android-sdk&gt;/sdk/java/* into Eclipse (Suppose you've got an Android development environment) and build it. For detailed steps, [this thread](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/android_binary_package/dev_with_OCV_on_Android.html) walks you through how to do Android development with OpenCV.
2. Change the variable *OPENCV_ANDROID_SDK_HOME* in *jni/Android.mk* to the path *<OpenCV-android-sdk>* above, in our project, add a reference to the OpenCV Java SDK in Project -> Properties -> Android -> Library -> Add select OpenCV Library, then strike command to finish native code building, and last, build this Android project.
```sh
$ cd jni
$ ndk-build -j4
$ cd ..
$ ant debug
```

For Win32/Linux project, [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) (CLI mode or GUI mode) is needed to generate native makefiles. Out-of-source build is recommended, as you can build multiple variants in separate directories. Compilers need to support some C++11 features, *Visual Studio* 2013 or newer works fine.
```sh
$ cd jni
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j4
```
